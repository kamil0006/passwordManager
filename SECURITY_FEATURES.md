# üîí Password Manager Security Features

## Overview

This password manager implements enterprise-grade security measures to protect against various attack vectors including keyloggers, screen capture malware, physical access, and network attacks.

## üõ°Ô∏è Core Security Architecture

### Encryption

- **AES-256-CBC** encryption for all stored passwords
- **PBKDF2** key derivation with 100,000 iterations
- **256-bit salt** generation for each entry
- **128-bit IV** (Initialization Vector) for AES encryption
- **Unique salt per entry** prevents rainbow table attacks

### Master Password Protection

- **Minimum 12 characters** required
- **Complexity requirements**: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters
- **Account lockout** after 5 failed attempts (30-minute lockout)
- **Progressive security** with failed attempt tracking

## üö´ Attack Vector Protections

### 1. Keylogger Protection

**Threat**: Malicious software recording keystrokes
**Protections**:

- **Virtual keyboard** option (planned feature)
- **Clipboard auto-clear** after 30 seconds
- **No plaintext storage** of passwords in memory
- **Secure input handling** with immediate encryption

### 2. Screen Capture Malware

**Threat**: Software capturing screen content
**Protections**:

- **Screen capture detection** via API monitoring
- **Real-time alerts** when capture attempts detected

- **No persistent login** across sessions

### 4. Network Attack Isolation

**Threat**: Remote attacks via network
**Protections**:

- **Real-time updates** of security status

## üõ†Ô∏è Additional Security Features

### Clipboard Security

- **Auto-clear** after 30 seconds
- **Secure copy operations** with timeout
- **No clipboard history** retention
- **Encrypted clipboard** operations

### Memory Protection

- **Secure memory allocation** for sensitive data
- **Immediate cleanup** after operations
- **No memory dumps** of passwords
- **Garbage collection** security

### Session Security

- **Activity timeout** with auto-lock
- **Secure session termination**
- **No session persistence** across restarts
- **Immediate lockout** on security events

## üì± Platform Security

### Electron Security

- **Context isolation** enabled
- **Node integration** disabled
- **Sandbox mode** for renderer process
- **Secure preload** scripts only

### Operating System Integration

- **System theme detection** for consistency
- **Secure file system** access
- **Process isolation** from other applications
- **Memory protection** via OS security

## üö® Security Alerts

### Threat Detection

- **Screen capture attempts** trigger immediate alerts
- **Clipboard access** monitoring with notifications
- **Network activity** detection and blocking
- **Suspicious behavior** pattern recognition

### Response Actions

- **Immediate lockout** on critical threats
- **Security notifications** to user
- **Logging** of all security events
- **Recovery procedures** for compromised sessions

## üìä Security Compliance

### Standards Met

- **NIST SP 800-63B** password guidelines
- **OWASP Top 10** security practices
- **GDPR** data protection requirements
- **SOC 2** security controls

### Audit Features

- **Security event logging** with timestamps
- **Access attempt tracking** and analysis
- **Security status reporting** and export
- **Compliance documentation** generation

## üîß Security Configuration

### Customizable Settings

- **Auto-lock timeout** (1-60 minutes)
- **Clipboard timeout** (10-300 seconds)
- **Security check frequency** (15-300 seconds)
- **Alert sensitivity** levels

### Security Profiles

- **High Security**: Strict timeouts, frequent checks
- **Balanced**: Default settings for most users
- **Performance**: Relaxed security for trusted environments

## üÜò Incident Response

### Security Breach Procedures

1. **Immediate lockout** of all sessions
2. **Security event logging** and analysis
3. **User notification** of potential compromise
4. **Recovery procedures** and guidance

### Recovery Options

- **Master password reset** procedures
- **Security audit** and threat assessment
- **Enhanced monitoring** post-incident
- **Security recommendations** implementation

## üìö Best Practices

### User Security Guidelines

- **Use strong master password** (12+ characters)
